    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Chicken Alfredo is a creamy pasta dish featuring fettuccine noodles coated
      in a rich, velvety Alfredo sauce made from butter, heavy cream, and
      Parmesan cheese. Tender pieces of cooked chicken are added to the pasta
      and sauce, creating a comforting and indulgent meal. The dish is known for
      its smooth, savory flavors and is often garnished with fresh parsley for a
      touch of color.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>8 oz fettuccine pasta</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><h4>Cook the Chicken:</h4></li>
      <p>
        Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in a
        skillet over medium heat. Cook the chicken for about 6-7 minutes per
        side, or until fully cooked and golden brown. Remove from the skillet,
        let rest for a few minutes, then slice into strips or cubes.
      </p>
      <li><h4>Cook the Pasta:</h4></li>
      <p>
        While the chicken is cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to a
        boil. Cook the fettuccine according to the package instructions until al
        dente. Drain and set aside.
      </p>
      <li><h4>Make the Alfredo Sauce:</h4></li>
      <p>
        In the same skillet used for the chicken, melt the butter over medium
        heat. Add the minced garlic and cook for about 1 minute, until fragrant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pour in the heavy cream and chicken broth. Bring to a simmer and cook
        for 2-3 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken slightly.
      </p>
      <li><h4>Add Cheese:</h4></li>
      <p>
        Stir in the grated Parmesan cheese until melted and smooth. Season with
        additional salt and pepper if needed.
      </p>
      <li><h4>Combine Pasta and Chicken:</h4></li>
      <p>
        Add the cooked fettuccine to the sauce, tossing to coat the pasta
        evenly. Add the sliced or cubed chicken on top and stir to combine.
      </p>
      <li><h4>Serve:</h4></li>
      <p>
        Garnish with chopped fresh parsley if desired. Serve the Chicken Alfredo
        hot.
