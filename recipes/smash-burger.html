    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      A smash burger is a type of hamburger made by pressing a ball of ground
      beef onto a hot griddle or skillet, creating a crispy, caramelized crust
      on the outside while keeping the inside juicy. The technique results in a
      burger with a rich, flavorful crust and a juicy interior, often topped
      with classic ingredients like cheese, lettuce, tomato, and pickles.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ground beef (80/20 blend of meat to fat ratio)</li>
      <li>Potato roll</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Pepper</li>
      <li>Cheese slice</li>
      <li>Lettuce</li>
      <li>Pickles</li>
      <li>Butter/oil for toasting buns</li>
      <li>Condiments</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><h4>Prepare the Ingredients:</h4></li>
      <p>
        Gather all your ingredients: ground beef, burger buns, cheese slices (if
        using), lettuce, pickles, etc.
      </p>
      <li><h4>Preheat Your Cooking Surface:</h4></li>
      <p>
        Heat a skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. If using a cast-iron
        skillet, make sure it's well-heated for a good sear.
      </p>
      <li><h4>Shape the Beef:</h4></li>
      <p>
        Form the ground beef into loose balls, about 4 to 6 ounces each. Don’t
        overwork the meat; it should be loosely packed.
      </p>
      <li><h4>Toast the Buns:</h4></li>
      <p>
        While the skillet heats up, butter the insides of the burger buns and
        toast them in a separate pan or on a griddle until golden brown. Set
        aside.
      </p>
      <li><h4>Cook the Patties:</h4></li>
      <p>
        Once the skillet is hot, place a beef ball onto the surface and use a
        spatula to press it down firmly, creating a thin patty. Press hard
        enough to make contact with the pan but don’t squish it too much.
      </p>
      <li><h4>Season the Patties:</h4></li>
      <p>Season the top of the patty with salt and pepper while it cooks.</p>
      <li><h4>Cook the Patties:</h4></li>
      <p>
        Let the patty cook without moving it for about 2-3 minutes, allowing a
        crispy crust to form. Flip the patty and immediately place a slice of
        cheese on top if using. Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until the
        cheese is melted and the patty reaches your desired level of doneness.
      </p>
      <li><h4>Assemble the Burgers:</h4></li>
      <p>
        Place the cooked patty on the bottom half of the toasted bun. Add your
        desired toppings: lettuce, tomato slices, pickles, onions, ketchup, and
        mustard.
      </p>
      <li><h4>Top and Serve:</h4></li>
      <p>
        Place the top half of the bun over the toppings. Serve immediately while
        hot and juicy.
