    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Pho is a traditional Vietnamese noodle soup known for its aromatic and
      flavorful broth, typically made from simmered beef or chicken bones. It
      features rice noodles (bánh phở), and is often served with a variety of
      fresh herbs, bean sprouts, lime wedges, and chili peppers, allowing each
      person to customize their bowl to taste. The rich broth, combined with
      tender meat and vibrant garnishes, makes pho a comforting and satisfying
      dish.

      <li>4 cups water</li>
      <li>1 star anise</li>
      <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon sugar (optional)</li>
      <li>8 oz rice noodles</li>
      <li>1/2 lb thinly sliced beef (such as sirloin) or cooked chicken</li>
      <li>Fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
      <li>Bean sprouts</li>
      <li>Lime wedges</li>
      <li>Thai basil leaves</li>
      <li>Sliced jalapeños or chili peppers (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><h4>Prepare the Broth:</h4></li>
      <p>
        In a large pot, add the beef or chicken bones and cover with water.
        Bring to a boil and then reduce the heat, simmering for about 10
        minutes. Discard the water and rinse the bones to remove impurities.
      </p>
      <li><h4>Simmer the Broth:</h4></li>
      <p>
        In the same pot, add the cleaned bones, onion, ginger, star anise, and
        cinnamon stick. Pour in 4 cups of fresh water. Bring to a boil, then
        reduce the heat and simmer for at least 1-2 hours, skimming off any foam
        that rises to the surface.
      </p>
      <li><h4>Season the Broth:</h4></li>
      <p>
        After simmering, strain the broth to remove the solids. Return the clear
        broth to the pot and season with fish sauce, salt, and sugar (if using).
        Adjust seasoning to taste.
      </p>
      <li><h4>Cook the Noodles:</h4></li>
      <p>
        Prepare the rice noodles according to the package instructions. Drain
        and set aside.
      </p>
      <li><h4>Assemble the Pho:</h4></li>
      <p>
        Divide the cooked rice noodles among bowls. Top with thinly sliced beef
        or cooked chicken. Pour the hot broth over the noodles and meat.
      </p>
      <li><h4>Add Toppings:</h4></li>
      <p>
        Garnish with fresh cilantro, bean sprouts, lime wedges, and Thai basil
        leaves. Add sliced jalapeños or chili peppers if desired.
      </p>
      <li><h4>Serve:</h4></li>
      <p>
        Serve the pho hot, allowing each person to add more garnishes or sauces
        according to their taste.
